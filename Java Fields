The below is simple program on fields and its behaviour. Learning concepts here.




package SWING; // Package Name

public class Car {
	
	// Declared state of the car, the fields mentioned below are encapsulated. 
  
	private String brand = "Benz";
	private String color = null; // The value is declared as null
	private String model = null; // The value is declared as null
	
	// Method to set the color
	public void setColor(String newColor){
		this.color = newColor; // this.color here points to the fields declared within the class template or member variable. 
	}
	
  // Method to set the brand name
	public String setBrand(String newBrand){
		this.brand = newBrand;
		return this.brand;
	}

 
  // Main method which compliers look for, Java compiler throws an error if there main method is not declared. 
  
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		
		Practice1 h = new Practice1(); // Created a new instance to store class fields and methods in a heap :-) Sorry. 
    System.out.println("Brand value before creating an instance: " + h.brand); // Value of the field found before method is executed.
    String n = h.setBrand("Volvo"); // We set the value of the brand to "Volvo"
    System.out.println("Brand value before creating an instance: " + n); // Value of the field in heap is changed. 
		

	}

}
